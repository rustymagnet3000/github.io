[iOS Static / Dynamic introspection](https://gist.github.com/rustymagnet3000/605c333519cd265c7eac9d556f46dc75) | This gist was my personal `Frida` cheatsheet and reminder list to find obvious errors in iOS apps.
[Run-time Objective-C Introspection](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_swizzles) | This repo became a curated list of `Swizzles`. At run-time you used a `Swizzle` to inspect `URLs, Labels, Cookies, etc`. Better still, you could use a `Swizzle` to bypass large chunks of codes (`Delegates`) or `Security Controls`.
[Derive RSA Private Key](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/rsa_objc_key_finder) | This repo was still `work-in-progress` but it was fun.  The idea was to derive a (short) RSA Private Key so you could reveal a secret.
[Debugger Cheat Sheets](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_debugger)  | I promised myself _"never write a `gdb` cheat-sheet"_. Promise broken.  Here was my attempt to cover well-trodden ground. More focus on `lldb` and `ghidra` lately.
