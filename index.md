### Introspection of iOS / macOS apps
I believe - hunting for bugs and flaws in software - is an invaluable skill that - used for good - raises the quality of shipped product.

This repo is largely geared towards `introspection` of software to understand what is it doing at `run-time`.

[Debugger Cheat Sheets](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_debugger)  | I promised myself _"never write a `gdb` cheat-sheet"_. Promise broken.  Here was my attempt to cover well-trodden ground.  More focus on `lldb` and `ghidra` lately.  
[iOS Static / Dynamic introspection](https://gist.github.com/rustymagnet3000/605c333519cd265c7eac9d556f46dc75) | This gist was my personal `Frida` cheatsheet and reminder list. Useful looking for obvious mistakes in `AppStore iOS apps`.
[Run-time Objective-C Introspection](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_swizzles) | This repo became a curated list of `Swizzles` I enjoyed using against iOS apps to inspect `URLs, Labels, Cookies`, or to even bypass data-in-transit Security controls.,
