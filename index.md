[iOS Static / Dynamic introspection](https://gist.github.com/rustymagnet3000/605c333519cd265c7eac9d556f46dc75) | Useful commands when inspecting iOS apps. Include a lot of `Frida` commands.
[Run-time Objective-C Introspection](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_swizzles) | At run-time, a `Method Swizzle` was great for inspecting `URLs, Labels, Cookies`, bypassing code or altering code flow.
[Derive RSA Private Key](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/rsa_objc_key_finder) | This macOS app derived a (short) RSA Private Key to reveal a secret. Work in progress.
[Debugger Cheat Sheets](https://github.com/rustymagnet3000/reverse_engineer_ios_with_debugger)  | I promised myself _"never write a `gdb` cheat-sheet"_. Promise broken. Also focused on `lldb` and `ghidra`.
